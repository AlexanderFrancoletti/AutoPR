Create a database of tournament results that pulls data automatically
	-Define the data set and types
	-Pull data from specific sources and update tables weekly/daily
	-Should be able to export database to CSV or spreadsheet

Specific files/functions I want
DatabaseInit - Just run once and it will setup the tables and database
Settings - Should make a script that can edit this file with the url, beginning date for the database, and the last time results were added
ResultScraper - Should take info from the settings file and use it to add results to the database


Data types and sources to pull from:
	-Challonge
	-Smash.gg

	-Players
		-ID
		-Tag
		-# of Tournaments

	-Match
		-ID
		-Tourney ID
		-Player 1
		-Player 2
		-Games won p1
		-Games won p2

	-Tournament
		-ID
		-Event Name - KEY

	-Head to Head
		-Player 1 - KEY
		-Player 2 - KEY
		-Record as Player 1 win percentage


Potential solutions:
Challonge has a REST api for tournaments and matches
Set the most recent update date as the last time the automator ran
Grab tournament ids from events by specifics users after the most recent update date
For each tournament id, grab the match data for the tournament and store the tournment data
Parse the match data into the player data, match data, and h2h results tables
